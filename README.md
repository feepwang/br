# Brain Rehabilitation

As you can see, the purpose of this repository is to exercise the brain.

After years of work, I have gradually felt rusty in using programming tools. This
includes both the basic data structures and algorithms used daily, and the construction
principles of toolchains/ecosystems and analysis/operation and maintenance tools
that are part of the development/production environment. This unfamiliarity makes
me feel panicked. Therefore, I plan to relearn/review and summarize these contents,
recording them in this repository.

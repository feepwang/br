This is a Go based Toolkit repostory.

### Go Version

We use Go 1.21+ for this project, some new features introduced after Go 1.21 will be provide with go build tags.
For example, you can use build tag for extensive function or methods for different Go versions.

### Dependencies

We prefer to use Golang std library as much as possible, the second choice is self-defined tool, every new dependency must be approved the maintainers.
